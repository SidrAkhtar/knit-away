<h1>:pencil: Description</h1>
<p>This web application is about Knitting. I designed this application for knitters who can view the patterns on my app without having to log in. A visiter is able to click on each patterns' image to view the details about that specific pattern.</p>
<p>If a visiter wants to access the full functionality of the app, then they will have to login using their Google account. Once logged in, a user will be able to Add a Pattern on the app and user will be able to access that added pattern in Patterns page. A user can also edit and delete their own patterns.</p>
<p>A user can also post comments on the pattern.</p>
